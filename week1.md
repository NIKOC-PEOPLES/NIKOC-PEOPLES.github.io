This week was my first week coding. I am very proud of the accomplishments I’ve made within a short week. We learned about coding languages, commuter, properties, generative, AI, pandas, Git and GitHub, ethics while using AI. There was lectures and courses taught about Co-Lab and how to properly code that were intrestingly fun.

 I was able to achieve different coding processes And printing various logistic And numerical data frames 

The Onboarding process has been enjoyable as we’ve had a great time with our peers to interact and have icebreakers enabling new ideas for our project. 

It was insightful to meet new people with like-minded goals, and create new networking connections.

Im greatful for th eoppurtunity to work this summer within the Summer AI Research Institute, furthering my education and corperate value.
